　　抗战末期，一群溃败下来的国民党士兵聚集在西南小镇禅达的收容所里，他们被几年来国土渐次沦丧弄得毫无斗志，只想苟且偷生。而日本人此时已经逼近国界，打算切断中国与外界的联系。
　　收容所里聚集了各色人物：孟烦了、迷龙、不辣、郝兽医、阿译等等。他们混日子，他们不愿面对自己内心存有的梦，那就是再跟日本人打一仗，打败日本人。因为他们已经不抱有任何希望了。他们活得像人渣，活着跟死了也差不多。
　　师长虞啸卿出现了，他要重建川军团。但真正燃起这群人斗志的是嬉笑怒骂、不惜使用下三滥手段的龙文章。龙文章成了他们的团长，让这群人渣重燃斗志，变成勇于赴死之人。
　　这些人从一开始就知道，自己的命运就是炮灰的命运，他们面对的是一场几乎必死无疑的战争。
　　这是迄今为止，唯一一部对得起“中国远征军”这五个字的中国远征军题材的小说。

[Content Introduction]
　　At the end of the Anti Japanese War, a group of defeated Nationalist soldiers gathered in a shelter in the southwest town of Chanda. They were left with no fighting spirit due to the gradual decline of their country over the years, and only wanted to make a living. At this point, the Japanese have already approached the border and intend to cut off China's connection with the outside world.
　　Various figures gathered in the shelter, including Meng Fan, Mi Long, Bu La, Hao Shouyi, A Yi, and so on. They live aimlessly, unwilling to face their own inner dreams of fighting against the Japanese again and defeating them. Because they no longer hold any hope. They live like scumbags, living and dying are almost the same.
　　Commander Yu Xiaoqing has appeared, he wants to rebuild the Sichuan Army. But what really ignited the fighting spirit of this group of people was the dragon article, which laughed and cursed, and even resorted to vulgar means. Long Wenwen became their leader, reigniting the fighting spirit of this group of scumbags and turning them into brave individuals willing to die.
　　These people knew from the beginning that their fate was the fate of cannon fodder, and they faced an almost inevitable war.
　　This is the only novel with the theme of "Chinese Expeditionary Force" worthy of the five words "Chinese Expeditionary Force" so far.
